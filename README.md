ChatGPT is used to provide suggestions whenever there are errors in my code. After implementing the code based on its guidance, both the histogram and scatter plot were plotted successfully using D3 and JavaScript. Furthermore, ChatGPT is also helpful in explaining the code, making it easier to understand how the charts are created and how can the knowledge be applied for other aspects.
